# NodeSorting
Map navigation assignment where I research differences in efficiency between the Dijkstra algorithm and ALT


Application that finds the shortest distance between any two given nodes, given that they are connected by road. The dataset is all crossroads in parts of northern Europe. The Program takes in two node numbers, and a given extra condition. You can select how many gas stations it should visit on its trip to the destination. 

After that the algorithms will run, and you will get an output of how many nodes each algorithm checked was suitable for the trip, the time of the trip in total, and the time the algorithm used to complete the calculations. The path is also stored in a CSV file with each individual crossroad, this can be put into any other third party software to get a visual representation of the shortest path.
